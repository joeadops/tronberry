# Tronberry

A daemon to fetch images from a Tronbyt server and display on a matrix LED display connected to a Raspberry Pi.

It has only been tested with a Raspberry Pi Zero 2W, but should work with all devices supported by https://github.com/hzeller/rpi-rgb-led-matrix.

## Installation

In order to avoid flickering, follow these steps (taken from https://github.com/hzeller/rpi-rgb-led-matrix?tab=readme-ov-file#troubleshooting):

- Set `dtparam=audio=off` in `/boot/firmware/config.txt`
- Add `isolcpus=3` at the end of `/boot/firmware/cmdline.txt`
- Run

```
cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-rgb-matrix.conf
blacklist snd_bcm2835
EOF
sudo update-initramfs -u
```
- Reboot

Now download either the latest binary release from https://github.com/tronbyt/tronberry/releases onto your Pi or build the Tronbyt client yourself on the device:

```sh
# Install dependencies
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y install git libwebp-dev libssl-dev zlib1g-dev

# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/tronbyt/tronberry.git

# Build
cd tronberry
make
```

## Running

```sh
# The Tronbyt URL looks like http(s)://…/next or ws(s)://…/ws
sudo ./tronberry ${TRONBYT_URL}
```

If you use `tronberry` with the original Tidbyt display, add the `--led-panel-type=FM6126A` flag. For a list of available options, run `./tronberry --help`, there are many knobs to tweak.

To start `tronberry` at startup, create `/etc/systemd/system/tronberry.service` with the following content:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Tronberry
After=network-online.target

[Service]
ExecStart=<ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_TRONBERRY> <TRONBYT_URL>
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Then run `sudo systemctl enable tronberry` to enable the new service.

To start it manually, run `sudo systemctl start tronberry`.
